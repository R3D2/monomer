* Understand and correctly use the OSC protocol. Currently everything is sent to /test. This can clearly be improved upon
  - for example, there is the /frame method which seemingly can be used to light all the leds at once
  
* Build a smarter way to create and manage independent threads of execution

* Look into communicating with monome directly (bypassing OSC) 
  - would that make things more efficient and be worth the effort?
  
* Create hooks to generate arbitrary OSC messages to control other devices
