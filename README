This is a Ruby library to interact with the fantastic box of wonder that is the monome (http://monome.org)

It is most definitely work in progress, is evolving rapidly, and is already great fun to play with :-)

This library has been developed and tested using a monome 128. If you have any issues with the 40h, 64 and 256 monomes, please contact me and I'll help as soon as I can.

In order to use this library, you must have monomeserial running. The address pattern prefix will be automatically set to /ruby_monome, and the cable orientation will be automatically set to up.

Enjoy!

P.S.

If you're planning on using a lot of threads, then I recommend using JRuby as the main interpreter. It's much faster (with cool stuff like JIT support) and has a decent thread implementation. If you're using JRuby, make sure you're using 1.1.2+ http://jruby.codehaus.org/

P.P.S. Thanks also to Ullrich Sch√§fe (stigi) for contributions to this library
