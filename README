This is a Ruby library to interact with the fantastic box of wonder that is the monome (http://monome.org)

It is most definitely work in progress, is evolving rapidly, and is already great fun to play with :-)

This library has been developed tested using a monome 128. Currently it doesn't directly support other monome devices, although this is planned. If you're interested in helping get this working on the 64/256 versions please feel free to contact me :-)

Enjoy!
